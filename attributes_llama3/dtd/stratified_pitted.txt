stratified texture which displays a layered appearance.
stratified texture which shows clear horizontal lines or bands.
stratified texture which has different materials or colors in each layer.
stratified texture which has varying thickness in its layers.
stratified texture which has a pattern that repeats in a regular or irregular manner.
stratified texture which shows a clear distinction between each layer.
stratified texture which may have different textures within each layer.
stratified texture which may show signs of erosion or weathering, indicating different periods of deposition.
stratified texture which may have layers that are not perfectly horizontal, indicating some form of disturbance or movement.
stratified texture which may have fossil or mineral inclusions that differ between layers.
stratified texture which may have a visible sequence of events or processes that have occurred over time.
stratified texture which may have a distinct, layered pattern that can be observed from a distance.
stratified texture which may have a sense of depth or dimensionality due to the layered appearance.
stratified texture which may have a clear, repeating pattern of layers, similar to the rings of a tree.
stratified texture which may have layers that are separated by a distinct boundary or interface.
stratified texture which may have a history of formation that can be inferred from the layers.
stratified texture which may have a complex, multi-layered structure that reveals information about its formation process.
stratified texture which may have a sense of stratification that is not immediately apparent, requiring closer inspection to reveal.
