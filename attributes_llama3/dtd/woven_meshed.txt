woven texture which displays a clear pattern of interlacing threads or fibers.
woven texture which shows a crisscross pattern, typically with two sets of threads or fibers at right angles.
woven texture which has a regular, repeating pattern that is consistent throughout the material.
woven texture which may show visible knots or loops where the threads or fibers intersect.
woven texture which may have a raised or bumpy surface due to the weaving process.
woven texture which may show variations in the thickness of the threads or fibers used.
woven texture which may have a distinct directionality, with the threads or fibers running in specific directions.
woven texture which may show signs of wear or fraying along the edges where the weave is exposed.
woven texture which may have a certain level of rigidity or stiffness, depending on the tightness of the weave.
woven texture which may have a certain level of transparency, depending on the thickness and spacing of the threads or fibers.
woven texture which typically has a more defined and structured appearance compared to meshed textures.
woven texture which often has a more uniform density and tightness of the weave.
woven texture which may have a more pronounced sheen or luster due to the interlacing of threads or fibers.
woven texture which often has a more defined edge or border, depending on the type of weave used.
woven texture which may have a more noticeable texture or tactile sensation due to the raised or bumpy surface.
woven texture which often has a more consistent and predictable appearance, with fewer open spaces or gaps.
woven texture which may have a more defined and visible pattern of thread or fiber intersections.
